This R script is designed to process FASTQ files 


1. (main) function processes a single FASTQ file.
    - It first checks if the file is gzipped (`.gz`): (`gzfile` for gzipped files, `file` for others) to open the file.
    - The first 400 lines of the file are read to extract sequencing information.
    - It extracts the flowcell and lane information from the first line of the file.
    - An index array is initialized to store indices extracted from every fourth line 
        -Handling cases where the sequencing index might not exist (e.g., non-multiplexed files) by inserting "NA".
    - The most frequent index is determined.
    - The run date is set dynamically based on the filename.
    - Various identifiers (like read group ID, platform unit, platform, etc.) are constructed.
    - The function returns a list of extracted metadata.

2. Non-interactive mode:
   - The script checks if it's running in non-interactive mode.
   - It defines input (FASTQ files directory) and output (metadata file) paths.
   - Lists all FASTQ files in the specified directory and processes each file using the `main` function.
   - The results are combined into a data frame and written to the output file.

3. (write_warnings_to_file) function to write warnings to a file :
   - The function is designed to capture and save any warnings generated during the script execution to a specified file. 
        -It uses `withCallingHandlers` to capture warnings and writes them to a file.

5. Integration of warning:
   - In addition to processing FASTQ files, the script also captures any warnings generated during this process and writes them to a file named "metadata_warnings.txt".
